                <p>I love drawing. Byfar it is my favorite hobby. I have made many drawing but recently I have been starting to draw in colored pencil. I have a tiktok account where I post all my art. Whenever I show people my art they think I did not make it so make timlapses so they believe me lol.</p>

            <div class="item" style="order:4;"><h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>I also love reading. Many of of friends have inspired me to start reading. I used to really dislike reading but they really pushed me to start. There are 2 book series that I <b>really like</b> Keeper Of the Lost Citites which is about a girl named Sophie who discovers she's an elf. The second one is the Percy Jackson and the Olympians which is about a boy who discovers he's the son of a Greek God.

            <div class="item" style="order:5;"><h2>Baking</h2><p>I don't bake all the time but I do consider a hobby of mine. i really like baking when I actually do it. The thing I dont like is that I have to deal with constant mistakes which can ruin it so I have to be extra carefull. Natasha's kitchen's videos have helped me alot in the recipes. So far I've made 7 recipes 2 cakes, brownies, cinnamon rolls, and cupcakes. It really fu actually!</div>
